# Lambert-s-Problem
- MATLAB code is iterated to calculate orbital elements of trajectory between two points in space and within given amount of time using Lambert's problem algorithm. 
- The orbital elements estimated from the lambert's estimation code, we can further use the data to calculate Delta-V requirement and ground track for the pathway.
- The ground track code is adapted from the work of M. Mahooti and input data of the given problem is entertained to obtain the ground track plot.
